Push starts off with a slower execution time than unshift. 
As we scale up, push ends up with the better execution time. 
This is not true for unshift for which the execution time increases significantly.
Unshift execution time ends up being 180 times slower for the extraLargeArray.
Unshift takes more time because it moves everything one spot over to the right.
Push takes less time as we scale up because it doesn't shift each position in an array.
It just adds to the tail end.
